          <h3>3D Graphics Prototyping Engineer</h3>
          <h3 style="color: #d1b9ff;">Apple - Cupertino, California</h3>
          <p>(2015 to present)</p>
          <p>As part of the Camera Incubation team at Apple, I design and develop interactive demos, simulations, visualization tools,
            and exploratory prototypes to evaluate next-generation camera hardware across a wide range of devices.
            Much of my work is confidential, but it lives at the intersection of 3D graphics, hardware validation, and immersive user experiences.
            While the prototypes are interactive and often visually engaging, they are grounded in rigorous scientific methodology.
            We validate our results against ground truth data to ensure accuracy.
            I use whatever language or software best fits the problem, often Unity, Blender, Python, or custom tools,
            and thrive as a generalist who bridges disciplines.</p>

        <h3>Master in Simulation and Virtual Reality</h3>
        (2009 - 2010)
        <p>During my studies, I had the opportunity to work on two fascinating projects that combined 3D modeling, history, and computer vision:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The first project involved recreating the Piccolo Theater in Chalon-sur-Sa√¥ne, France, using city archives and photogrammetry to model its evolution across three key years: 1769, 1778, and 1886. Visitors at the Image Institute could then immerse themselves in these historical periods using our Cave system.</li>
          <li>The second project, in collaboration with CSIRO and the University of Canberra, Australia, focused on illustrating how remote-controlled robots can perform tasks beyond the user's view by creating a real-time 3D representation of the scene.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>üé∏ My Music</h2>
        <p>I‚Äôve always had a passion for creating music and videos. My journey began with writing songs and recording on cassette tapes, and over the years,
          I‚Äôve evolved into using Ableton to produce music. For my videos, I shoot with a DSLR or my iPhone using AppleLog, edit in DaVinci Resolve and recently incorporated Blender for VFX.
          My musical journey has led me through several exciting projects, including starting a Japanese rock band when I moved to San Francisco playing all the anime convention including the Anime Expo in LA,
          forming a pop-rock-electro duo with my wife, and more recently diving into a synthwave solo project to channel my nostalgia for the 80s and 90s. Happy listening!</p>

        <h2>üß™ My Experiments</h2>
        <p>When I get the chance, I love building playful prototypes that blend technology, music, and art.
          These are some personal projects I built at home, driven by curiosity, creativity and a desire to keep learning.</p>
        <h3>üé∏ Projection Mapping Guitar</h3>
        <!-- (2023) -->
        <p>A projection mapping proof of concept where I captured my guitar‚Äôs pitch, turned it into a live sine wave animation with a custom Unity shader,
          and projected it directly onto the guitar's neck. I used an OptiTrack Trio to track the guitar‚Äôs position in real-time so the animation stayed aligned as I moved.
          The registration was a bit rough, but I'd love to revisit this idea in the future using ARKit.</p>

        <h3>üé∂ Audio-Synced Animation Show</h3>
        <!-- (2019) -->
        <p>My wife and I are a musical duo called Mochii Project. For one of our live performances,
          I created a variety of simple Unity-powered visuals that synced with the tempo and triggered at specific moments within the songs.
          I‚Äôve always wanted to create a fully immersive show experience, and this was my modest first attempt.
          I'd love to build something even more ambitious in the future.</p>

        <h3>üé∏ The Mangaster</h3>
        <!-- (2018) -->
        <p>A DIY electric guitar I built by assembling custom-selected hardware and decorating the body with pages from Knights of Sidonia, one of my favorite manga.
          I wanted the pages to be in Japanese, so I bought two extra volumes during one of our trips to Japan.</p>

        <h3>üõπ Electric Skateboard</h3>
        <!-- (2014) -->
        <p>A DIY electric skateboard I built from scratch, controlled with an Arduino and a Bluetooth Wii Nunchuck clone.
          It turned out way more powerful than expected and worked great ‚Äî at first. However,
          I quickly learned that Bluetooth signals were very prone to interference in a big city like San Francisco, and unfortunately,
          the safety mechanisms I coded didn't work as intended. Luckily, nobody got hurt, but it scared me enough to shelve the project and rethink the remote system.</p>

        <h3>ü§ò Leap Motion Rock</h3>
        <!-- (2013) -->
        <p>While I was working at Autodesk, I got early access to the Leap Motion device.
          On my first weekend with it, I coded a simple MIDI interface to control a drum plugin and some guitar and piano effects in real-time.
          I wrote a fun little tune and shot a silly video to go with it.

        <!-- (2007) -->
        <p>I built a surfboard from scratch between classes in Cluny. I designed the profile using specialized software,
          shaped the foam with a hot wire cutter, glassed it with a vacuum chamber, and made the fins by hand.
          The first time I took it to the Pacific, we got zero waves for the whole week we were there that summer üòÖ</p>
